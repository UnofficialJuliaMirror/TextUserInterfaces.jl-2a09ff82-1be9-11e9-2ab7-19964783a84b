TextUserInterfaces.jl
=====================

**WARNING**: This package should be considered pre-alpha!

This package wraps the C library **ncurses** and provide a Julia-like API to
build text user interfaces. The development was highly based on the package
[TermWin.jl](https://github.com/tonyhffong/TermWin.jl).
